    <h1>Intrests in IT</h1>

    <h3>When and Why IT?</h3>
    <p>I didn’t really have a point where I had a spark to pick IT as I have been using it ever since I got my first
      laptop in grade 6. But the point where I chose IT was when my school had job career/course advice and I hadn’t
      thought of any career that I wanted to go for, so I picked the one I had the most interest in which was IT.</p>

    <h3>Why RMIT?</h3>
    <p>I picked RMIT because I wanted to look for higher education to assist me in finding a job that I wanted. After browsing
      through some universities, I heard that RMIT was a really good university from relatives/friends. They said although the
      popular unis such as Monash, Melbourne Uni had high success rate, the professors and cohort wasn’t exactly a place where
      people could communicate well with one another and that RMIT was a better experience for them overall. Therefore, I followed
      their advice and picked RMIT.</p>

    <h3>What I expect to learn</h3>
    <p>Coming into RMIT, I thought the course was just going to be about IT systems. After joining this course, I learnt there
      is much more to this course as it also tries to teach teamwork in the workplace. Now I expect to learn much more than just
      IT systems. I believe by the end of this course I will learn how to interact with other people better and about how IT systems work.</p>

    <h3>Why this job?</h3>
    <p>I believe that this job is my ideal job as it allows me to become useful to the community by keeping the tram

    <h1>Personality test</h1>

    <h3>The Tests:</h3>
    <p>1.<a href="#"> https://www.16personalities.com </a></p>
    <p>According to the 16 personalities test I am an ISFP-T</p>
    <img src="personality_test.PNG" alt="ISFP-T">
    <p>2. Learning test</p>
    <p>According to the <a href="#"> http://www.educationplanner.org</a>  test i am a visual learner.</p>
    <p>3. Any test I wanted</p>
    <p>I did a test from <a href="#"> https://www.testcolor.com</a> and it showed me that I can listen to others, and I show a good
      emotional intelligence.</p>

    <h3>What do these results mean?</h3>
    <p>The results shown above mean that I am very introverted. This may show that I want to stay in my comfort
      zone and plan carefully before leaving it and sharing my ideas with everyone.</p>

    <h3>How will these results influence me in a team</h3>
    <p>These results may show that I can plan carefully and be able to support everyone else in a team.</p>

    <h3>How should I form a team based on results?</h3>
    <p>The project that I have come up with is a program that lets you order the most popular item in a
      shop to the least popular item. This means that shopkeepers/owners can keep track of their items and will
      be able to see what is selling most and what is selling the least. By having the items ranked by popularity customers can also
      look at what others are buying to see what could suit them better. </p>


    <h1> Project Idea</h1>

    <h3>Project itself</h3>
    <p>The project that I have come up with is a program that lets you order the most popular item in a shop to the
      least popular item. This means that shopkeepers/owners can keep track of their items and will be able to see what
      is selling most and what is selling the least. By having the items ranked by popularity customers can also look at
      what others are buying to see what could suit them better. </p>

    <h3>Why it would be interesting</h3>
    <p>This could be interesting as owners of a business could use this data to decide if an item is valuable or
      not. Owners could decide to lower the price of less popular items and if the price is too low to make any profit
      the item could be removed. This project could also help the customers as newer customers may not know what to buy and
      be able to look at the list of most popular to least and have a gauge to what people like most.</p>

    <h3>Description of project</h3>
    <p>The project will sort items bought by people from highest to lowest based on popularity. This will be a very helpful tool
      for owners to decide on what to do. This will also help customers by helping them view most popular to least. However, although
      it is very useful it comes with a disadvantage that being customers may try to stay away from the least popular item which may
      cause the least popular item to never come back up. </p>
    <p>This will be done by having a list of items and whenever an item is bought it will be sent to the program that will
      sort them from most bought to the least bought. The popularity of each item will be calculated by having a +1 to that
      item every time someone buys that item. This will also be shown to customers on another screen.</p>

    <h3>What tools/skills the project needs</h3>
    <p>This project will need to be able to have a list of items and be able to change the values of each item so
      therefore python may be needed to be able to code this. It will also need to display this on another screen, so
      html is also needed. Finally, to do all these a computer must be needed to use these programs. Therefore, the skills
      required for this project will be python for the coding and html to create a website. </p>
